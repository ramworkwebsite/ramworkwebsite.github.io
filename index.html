							<h2>Shipping container residential addition</h2>
							<p>This beautiful blue structure acts as an extension to the original building, 
								and is elevated 1 storey (via moment frame) to provide parking below. 
								The shipping container rooftop privacy screen was engineered to be safe yet easy on the eyes. 
								My involvement was the complete structural design and inspection while at Contact Engineering.

							<h2>Custom 3 storey residential</h2>
							<p>How do you blow out the back walls of a house for elegant glass doors and windows 
								without comprimising structural integrity? The answer: multi storey moment frames.

							<h2>Skytable flying shoring platform</h2>
							<p>Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, this is PERI's skytable flying slab-shoring system. Used often in
								multi-storey buildings, the platform is able to be crane-lifted between levels to save time and labour
								when forming concrete slabs. My involvement was the complete structural design and inspection while at Peri Canada.

							<h2>Custom 2 storey residential</h2>
							<p>This house made use of underpinning to create a deep and spacious basement, as well as LVL beams to vault a towering roof profile.
								Infilled with a floor addition, mezzanine, bay windows cantilevers, and carport slab, this expansive renovation is quite a 
								remarkable feat of residential engineering.

							<h2>GTA Condo</h2>
							<p>Early on in my career at Peri Canada, this massive project was my pride and joy. The project included a midrise concrete condo and 3
								adjacent townhouses for which I had designed all of the slab shoring and wall formwork. As you can imagine, this project's 
								drawing set for temp. works was extensive, detailed, and emphasized cost efficient design.

							<p>This photo shows the insulated concrete forms (ICF) of the foundations for modular housing up in North Ontario. 
								The entire project consists of 10 houses to be developed together.

							<h2>Engineered wood specialty</h2>
							<p>A good engineer is one that has extensive knowledge of their building materials and what to use
								when the first material does not work out. This photo illustrates using full height LSL studs in the design instead of wood studs 
								when typical wood studs are too short to span multistorey.

							<h2>Maximo 6m tall formed concrete walls</h2>
							<p>6ft is pretty tall when it comes to the average human. 6m is hard to imagine until you are on site next to a 6m 
								form for a poured concrete wall. My involvement was the design of temporary forms and bracing while at Peri Canada.

							<h2>Downtown 3 storey triplex</h2>
							<p>One of my first projects at Contact Engineering was this 3 storey triplex. The structure is mainly wood framed, but 
								also utilizes cold formed steel design for non-combustible construction requirements. This project first 
								introduced me to cold formed steel design in combination with wood and structural steel.

							<h2>Demolition Permit Temporary Works</h2>
							<p>When a house is built 100 years ago and starts slanting like a sinking ship, how do you safely demolish it
								without blowing a hole in your wallet? This was a great project where I used wood to temporarily shore and brace
								an entire 2-storey house from the inside while it was being demolished.

							<h2>Modular housing</h2>
							<p>Cost-efficiency at its peak is building a house in a factory, shipping it to site and having it lifted into place.
								My involvement was the structural consulting and shop approval process while at Contact Engineering.

							<h2>Skylight and half house vault renovation</h2>
							<p>I've seen skylights and I've seen solartubes, but I've seen nothing like this in a Toronto home.
								This design involved an enormous skylight placed in the center of the roof, with half of the roof being vaulted
								and the other half remaining with a conventional ceiling.

							<h2>Engineered demolition (construction engineering)</h2>
							<p>Hi Ram, we want to cut a hole in the upper wall, cut the existing concrete stairs, and crane them out of the building.
								Can you help us do this? Hi Contractor, that sounds challenging but a lot of fun. Lets make it happen!

									<h2>Hi there!</h2>
									<p>My name is Ram and I have been interested in construction and engineering for as long as I can remember. 
										As a kid, I would find ways to reinforce my snowman in my backyard;
										 now I take pride in designing resilient structurals and creative solutions to renovations.
										  As my experience in structural design, temporary works, and consulting continues to grow, I look forward to adding value 
										  to projects and being a helpful part of the team.</p>
